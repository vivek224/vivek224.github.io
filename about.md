Some page content here about myself ...

I'm a Computer Scientist at the University of Southern California's Information Sciences Institute. I received a PhD in May 2015 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I work on making&nbsp;</font><font size="3">computer programs
           used to solve problems in science and engineering run
           faster on supercomputers. Specifically, I develop
           low-overhead loop scheduling strategies to improve
           scalability of bulk-synchronous MPI+OpenMP applications run
           on clusters of SMPs. If you
           would like to know more about me, please click on the links
           above. Publications representative of my research are
